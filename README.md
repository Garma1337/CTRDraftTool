# Better Drafting Tool

I developed this tool mostly in 2020 and haven't made any changes since then. It was created on the fly by a spontaneous idea
but I never management to finish it besides the drafting itself. You would set up a web application very differently nowadays, like 
using react as a frontend instead of hacking around with jQuery.

## Track / Arena Drafting

The better drafting tool was developed for CTR:NF as a replacement for Leniovias' original drafting tool.
Compared to his tool, my tool contains draft options such as removing Spyro Circuit or Hyper Spaceway from the track selection
as well as having the option to do drafting for battle mode.

## Leaderboards

I was initially planning to add a ranked leaderboard management to the tool but never finished the work on it as it's a lot of work.
If you want to continue the project, feel free.
